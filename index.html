The South Africa national rugby union team (Afrikaans: Suid-Afrikaanse nasionale rugbyspan) commonly known as the Springboks (colloquially the Boks, Bokke or Amabhokobhoko),[1] is the country's national team governed by the South African Rugby Union. The Springboks play in green and gold jerseys with white shorts. Their emblem is a native antelope, the Springbok, which is the national animal of South Africa. The team has been representing South African Rugby Union in international rugby union since 30 July 1891, when they played their first test match against a British Isles touring team. They are currently the number one ranked rugby team in the world and the reigning World Champions, having won the World Cup on a record four occasions (1995, 2007, 2019 and 2023). They are also the second nation to win the World Cup consecutively (2019 and 2023), and stand second to their rivals the All Blacks in terms of success in international rugby.
